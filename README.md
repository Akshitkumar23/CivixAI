IN AI-Based Government Scheme Eligibility & Benefit Optimizer

An AI & Machine Learning powered web application that helps Indian citizens discover eligible government schemes, estimate benefits, and get priority-based recommendations using personalized data.

🚀 A real-world Applied AI + Data Science + Full-Stack project focused on social impact and e-governance.

📌 Problem Statement

India has 1000+ Central & State Government Schemes, but:

Citizens don’t know which schemes they are eligible for

Eligibility rules are complex and scattered

Benefits worth ₹2+ lakh crore remain unclaimed every year

Existing portals only provide static information

❌ No personalization
❌ No eligibility intelligence
❌ No benefit optimization

💡 Solution Overview

This project uses Machine Learning + NLP to:

Analyze user profile (age, income, state, category, occupation, etc.)

Automatically check scheme eligibility

Estimate expected benefit amount

Rank schemes based on usefulness & priority

Think of it as:

“Netflix for Government Schemes” 🎯
