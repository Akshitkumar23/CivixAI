## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated teal (#46999d) to inspire confidence and trustworthiness, avoiding the cliché of Indian flag colors. Use a transparent overlay with light shadows.
- Background color: Light gray (#f0f2f5), a very desaturated variant of the primary color to be easy on the eyes. Use a transparent overlay with light shadows.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#f2a365), approximately 30 degrees from teal on the color wheel to stand out clearly for CTAs and important information. Use a transparent overlay with light shadows.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, suitable for body text.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for a touch of elegance
- Use simple, recognizable icons to represent schemes and required documents. Use bright colors.
- Employ a step-by-step layout for form input and a card-based design for scheme results.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to guide the user through the app.
